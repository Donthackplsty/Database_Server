# Introduction Of Database_Server

A small project that a trainee programmer like me is working on, there's a very low chance that someone will actually come accross this repository but it would be nice if you would leave any tips or guidance by opening a issue.

# What The Project Is: 

It is basically a Password Storer that allows you to store your passwords on a local server in a JSON file. You have a: <br>
=> Client <br>
Main Menu, This is the User-Side of things <br>
=> Server <br>
Taking needed information from the database and sending it to the Client <br>
=> Database <br>
Resposible for taking information out of the JSON file and sending it to the server <br>

# Note:

This project is purely for learning experience and holds very little or no practical use, if you wish to fork/clone this it is up to you.
